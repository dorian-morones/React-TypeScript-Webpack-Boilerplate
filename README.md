### March 3, 2020

Simple React config with React, Typescrip and webpack also works with sass and svg icons :D

### How install?

Perform ``` yarn install``` or ``` npm install ```.

Once you install all dependencies the code is ready for new components and ready for production.


### Available Scripts
 you can run:

 ``` yarn dev```  
 Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

 ``` yarn dev```  
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
